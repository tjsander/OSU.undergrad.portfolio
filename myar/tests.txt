##### MY ADDITIONAL TESTS CAN BE RUN USING "make alltests" ######

Tests required by the assignment run with "make tests"

Tested trying to add files to a non-archive file. It went ahead 
and appended text files to my makefile, so I added a boolean 
function to check that the file is a valid archive. Added to all
functions opening an archive.

Tested trying to add files to already-existing archive. Archive
was not passing validation. Culprit was WRONLY. Changed to RDWR.
[ added testq1234512 ]

Added tests for -x. (These tests added before mandatory section 4
tests from the assignment to extract the 1-s.txt... from junk.a)
	1. remove the two archives named "testx"
	2. Extract junk.a using ar -xo, then ar q to a new archive. 
	3. Extract junk.a and myar -x and myar -q to a new archive 
	4. diff the resulting two files.
(This also provides another layer of testing for -q)

Testing -d, there is some unexpected output when deleting large
numbers of files. Turned out to be a simple problem with evening 
the bits out after deletion. Function now passes -d tests:
	1. Create two ar files with same contents
	2. Remove 2 and 4 using ar and myar, diff
	3. Remove 3, diff

For -A I simply ran the command in the current directory. I 
checked that the filename did not match '.', '..', 'myar', 
'sig_demo' (to avoid adding the binary files to the ar), as well
as the name of the ar (to avoid an infinite loop).
